* HPC Containers

This GIT entry is the companion for the paper entitled "Assessing the
Computation and Communication Overhead of Linux Containers for HPC
Applications", by Guilherme Rezende Alles, Alexandre Carissimi, and
Lucas Mello Schnorr. The paper has been submitted to WSCAD 2018.

We have conducted multiple performance experiments with HPC
applications running inside Docker and Singularity containers. 

The repository contains:

- code to build a Docker cluster infrastructure. Highly influenced by
  [[https://github.com/NLKNguyen/alpine-mpich][NLNKguyen's work]]: Docker images and the multi-host orchestration are
  kept mostly intact, with some minor tweaks.
- Based on the same Docker images, there are some Singularity
  definition files to create singularity containers for performance
  analysis.
- An automated script to run experiments (configured in a .csv file)
  is also included.
- Results are kept in the =results= directory.
